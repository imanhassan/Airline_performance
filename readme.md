## Dataset

the data contian 14,462,943 rows , the data have 17 features (Year, Month, DayofMonth, UniqueCarrier, DayofWeek, ArrDelay, DepDelay, orgin, Dest, Cancelled, CancellationCode, Diverted, NASDelay, CarrierDelay, LateAircraftDelay, WeatherDelay,SecurityDelay). The data contian numirical and categorical variables.


## Summary of Findings

I was fouced in my Exploratory analysis to figure out the reasons for cancellation and delays that happend to flights and to point out to the years, months and daus that the delays happends the most. I Found out that there is strong relationship between Arrival delay and Departure delay. in addition there is positive relation ship between late aircraft delay and Arrival and deperture delay. Furthermore, Carrier delay can effect the Departure and Arrival delay.

Saturday is the lowest number of flight day over the 2 years. Moreover, late Air craft that which cauesd by the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport is way higher in 2008 than 2007 and it has a relationship with deperature delay and this is expected cause the delays comes from the previous flight. Furthermore, Some airlines operators has more cancelation and delay time more than others such as American Eagle Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlirs. 

Finally, Multivariate exploration gives the most effective results. In 2008 the Carrier Delay minutes reach more than 2007. That indicate that delay within the control of the air carrier. In addition, we can see that HA: Hawaiian Airlines that has the highest minutes of delay within their control reach to 33 minutes followed by YV: Mesa Airlines and then EV: Atlantic Southeast Airlines. So to know which month has the highest carrier delay based on 2008 has the highest carrier delay. As we see Hawaiian Airlines has the highest delay in 2008 specially at Feb, March, Sep, and Nov. in addition, the months has lower range but higher median compered to YV: Mesa Airlines that has high range at all months. August is the highest month of carrier delay caused by YV: Mesa Airlines. Jan, Aug, and Sep are the highest in EV:Atlantic Southeast Airlines. AQ: Aloha Airlines has delays only in Jan and Feb but with high median.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the persenation, i fouced on the most important indicatiors. clusterd bar charts is the main one that i used that because the majorty of the data used is categorical data. i post the graph that answer which day of the week a top airport has the highest delay caused by periveuse delay of same aircraft. Monday at ORD: Chicago O'Hare International Airport has the highest delays, followed by Friday and Thursday. ATL: Atlanta International Airport is the next high late aircraft delay. We can say that chicago airport has a lot of delay even in Arrival and departure delay and that needs to be improve.  the other graph is boxplot with facegride that fouce in which Airline has the highest delay and cancellation. HA: Hawaiian Airlines that has the highest minutes of delay within their control reach to 33 minutes followed by YV: Mesa Airlines and then EV: Atlantic Southeast Airlines. that also has been diged out to month by month delay.
